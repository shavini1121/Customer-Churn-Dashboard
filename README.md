*Customer Churn Analysis - Bank Customer Data
📝 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using real-world bank customer data. The objective is to understand why customers leave a bank and build predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning. This helps financial institutions take proactive steps to retain customers.

📁 Dataset
The dataset contains features such as:

Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Geography)

Bank-related details (Credit Score, Balance, Tenure, Products)

Behavioral factors (Active status, Has credit card)

Target variable: Exited (1 = Churned, 0 = Active)

🔍 Project Workflow
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values, encoded categorical data, scaled numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized customer trends and correlations between features and churn.

Model Building
Trained and compared models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Evaluation
Used metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate performance.

Insights
Identified key factors affecting churn and provided actionable recommendations.<img width="1262" height="679" alt="Dash board image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3eeb2de3-15dc-4c99-8af3-fa60edd1b2ec" />
